1. To enhance the Recipe Display Application for my recipe, I left only the click 
    function as my event feature. I thought the 'toggle' animation was too fast for 
    the user to read amount of information given on the page even with the animation
    being on the slow option. Thus, the click function provides a cleaner look as 
    the user can access the information on the page in a neat fashion.
2. Additionally, the recipe display application remains enhanced by the colored 
    background change when a user hovers over the "Ingredients" or "Instructions"
    header. By coloring the background when a user hovers over the headers, this 
    will signal the user that the headings are interactive. The "yellow" colored 
    heading tells the user that they are able to click on the heading. The "pink" 
    colored heading tells the user that they have clicked on the heading and should 
    now be viewing the information for the ingredients, instructions, or both.
3. While using the Google Developer tools, the recipe display application will 
    perform at least one DOM transversal statement. During my trial of a DOM
    transversal statement, I entered the statement <b> $("li").html("yum yum yum")</b>
    in the JavaScript Console located in the Google Developer tools. This statement 
    should change all of the ingredients to the words "yum yum yum". After entering 
    the code into the JavaScript Console for my recipe display application, the trial
    was successful. The all the listed ingredients did indeed change to "yum yum yum".
